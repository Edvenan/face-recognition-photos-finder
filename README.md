# Photo finder tool

Building AI course Final Project 

## Summary

Tool to find pictures of particular person in a photo storage system.


## Background

Have you ever found yourself before a birthday or anniversary where you need to collect as many photos as possible of a given person in order to create a photo album but you are confronted with a hard disk drive with thousands of random pictures and skimming through each one is an impossible task? 

Well, the purpose of this project is to automate such task so that by training a Machine Learning model with tpictures of the target person, the model finds for you all those photos containing such person.


## How is it used?

In order to train the model, we store in a folder a few pictures of the target person only (The more the merrier).
By using a face recognition algorithm, themodel will use the parameters extracted from the training photos and compare them with each photo in the photo storage system.

Everytime the model finds a match it will copy and store the mathching photo in a separate folder so that you end up with all the matching photos of the target person classified in a separate folder.

The folder structure is as follows:
./
scripts.py
/input/
/database/
/output/

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)
![Cat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
