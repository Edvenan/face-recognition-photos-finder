# face-recognition-photos-finder
Tool to find pictures of particular person in a photo storage system

Have you ever found yourself before a birthday or anniversary where you need to collect as many photos as possible of a given person in order to create a photo album but you are confronted with a hard disk drive with thousands of random pictures and skimming through each one is an impossible task? 

Well, the purpose of this project is to automate such task so that by training a Machine Learning model with tpictures of the target person, it finds for you all those photos containing such person.

This project is written in Python and uses face recognition libraries.
